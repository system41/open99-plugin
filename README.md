## FAQ
> What is open99-plugin?  
  **open99-plugin is a javascript library designed for convenience on open99.**  
  
> How is open99 different from Windows99?  
  **open99 provides the vast majority of the code for System41's Windows99 project. Windows99 is a closed-source project almost identical to open99, also owned by the System41 team. It can be accessed at [this URL](//windows99.vercel.app)**  
  
> Why is open99 small/empty?  
  **open99 is currently empty until Windows99's first release. This is because Windows99 started before open99, and for reasons having to do with synchronizing open99 with Windows99, since most of open99's code will come from Windows99 during the initial commit. This will not ever happen again after the initial commit**  
  
> When will open99 be released/When will Windows99's first release be released?  
  **The release date is TBD. open99 and Windows99 take a lot of time to develop.**  
  
open99 will remain read-only until news of Windows99's first release. open99-plugin will stay open during the period, however.
